I kept 20% of the original dataset for testing, then the 80% that went to training got further split as 20% is used for validation. After training on this dataset, the plain RNN, LSTM, and GNU models all have fairly similar Root of Mean Squared Error values and do not have major differences. RNN's use sequential time series data to make sequential predictions by associating each layer of the network with where that element is in the sequence. LSTM maintians a short term memory and caries the cell state through the gates of the network to avoid potential RNN pitfalls like the vanishing gradient problem, and make it more accurate for longer sequences. A GRU network only has two gates to do reset and update, so is less complex and uses less memory than LSTM. For this application, there doesn't appear to be a significant difference between the 3 implementations.\n",

Cosine similarity is very useful because you can calculate which words are similar to each other, which has applications in text parsing and sentiment analysis."
